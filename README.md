# MyHTMLProjects
This Repository contains my HTML Projects that i have completed.
The first HTML Website is a Restaurant Website that i have created using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
I made the use of tags like form tag to make a login page and div tag with the display grid property to make a gallery for the Restaurant.
Also made use of Javascript to validate the forms so that users did not make simple mistakes while filling the forms.
Also made use of CSS to beautify the HTML page and bring some life into to it.
